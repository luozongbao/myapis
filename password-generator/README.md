# Password Generator API & Web Interface

A comprehensive and secure password generator with customizable options, strength analysis, and both REST API and responsive web interface. Generate strong passwords with various character sets, length constraints, and security features.

## üîê Features

### üéØ Password Generation API
- **Customizable length**: User-defined min/max character constraints (1-128 characters)
- **Character type control**: Lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols
- **Security options**: Exclude ambiguous characters, prevent repeated characters
- **Custom symbols**: Define your own symbol set
- **Batch generation**: Generate 1-100 passwords at once
- **Strength analysis**: Real-time password strength evaluation
- **Quality assurance**: Ensure each character type is included
- **Cryptographically secure**: Uses `random_int()` for secure randomization

### üåê Web Interface
- **Modern responsive design**: Beautiful gradient UI that works on all devices
- **Interactive configuration**: Visual checkbox options and input controls
- **Real-time feedback**: Password strength indicators and analysis
- **Copy functionality**: Copy individual passwords or all at once
- **Password analysis**: Detailed strength breakdown with improvement tips
- **Security tips**: Built-in security recommendations
- **Loading states**: User feedback during generation
- **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone or download the project to your web server
2. Ensure PHP is installed (version 7.0 or higher recommended)
3. Place the files in your web server's document root or subdirectory
4. Ensure the web server has read permissions for all files

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Character Sets
- **Lowercase**: `a-z` (26 characters)
- **Uppercase**: `A-Z` (26 characters)  
- **Numbers**: `0-9` (10 characters)
- **Symbols**: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?` (25 characters)
- **Custom symbols**: User-defined symbol sets

### Security Options
- **Exclude ambiguous**: Removes confusing characters like `0O1lI|`
- **No repeated characters**: Ensures each character appears only once
- **Must include each type**: Guarantees at least one character from each selected type
- **Cryptographic randomness**: Uses PHP's secure `random_int()` function

## üîß Development

### Adding Custom Character Sets
```php
// In api/index.php, modify character sets
private $custom_charset = 'your_characters_here';
```

### Extending Strength Analysis
Modify the `analyzePassword()` method to implement custom scoring logic.

### API Integration
The API follows REST principles and returns JSON responses, making it easy to integrate with any application.

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Environment-Specific Settings
- **Development**: Lower security for testing
- **Production**: Maximum security requirements
- **Enterprise**: Custom symbol sets and policies

### Batch Operations
- Generate multiple password sets
- Different requirements per batch
- Bulk analysis capabilities
